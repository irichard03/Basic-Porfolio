# Basic-Porfolio

Doesn't valdiated because I used inline for background, css wants a URL I liked background I downloaded though. I guess I coold replace with url now that seems kind of dodgy to deploy wthout the asset inplace.

Didn't go for bonus stuff, I did the text area wrong and spent hours trying to figure out why it wouldn't resize.

I tried out git reset -hard on Sunday after I messed up my formatting pretty bad.  Losing 4 hours work turned out better as I finally took the time to wireframe the site afterwards and was able to position thing relatively where I want them.

Also I orginially had a cat picture for first image on portfolio page, it skewed really bad when I resized so I replaced it, but I was lazy and just named the image cat instead of updating the url.

The portfolio picture is my face at 3AM last Friday while I was struggling with the header margins, before I figured out to set them to auto.

Super fun!
